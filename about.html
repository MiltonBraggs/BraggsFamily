        By the Grace of God, this modest work is a popular compilation of the history and ancestry of our BRAGGS family. This is the outcome of what I have ever heard and read about our people. By no means this is complete, perfect or
accurate due to many limitations since oral tradition is the main source of this work. BRAGA is the capital of the Minho Province of northern Portugal, the natives of which were called BRAGG. During the conversion in Goa, some took this surname. It is quite different from Braganza. Bragg resided in old Goa-403403, in and around Ribandar. During the great pestilence many of them perished, the rest were scattered abroad. As on today no trace of them there. However one of them, EMMANUEL (around 1753) by name was brought by Rev. Fr.Salvadore in 1768 upon his transfer to Omzoor. He was helpful in the parochial and domestic work. The surname Bragg, was in vogue till 1900, after which it is found as Braggs in the records. Emmanuel, eventually married Therese Pereira of CANA, in Badoor village, Bantwal Taluk, D.K. Dt. And settled down in life with his father in law, who taught him the cultivation of beatle leaves. He started supplying Paan even to the palace of Tippu Sultan. Due to this reason his family was spared from the torture and deportation of the Christians in 1784. Their family consisted of Philip-1(1784)=Mornel, Paul-1(1787)-Piad, John-1(1790)=Ascess, and James-1(1795)=Anna-1805.The Church records of 1862 make mention of the heads of the Bragg families. When we tally them with the oral tradtion we get a glimpse of the early history of the Family. Zoanna-1809, daughter in law of Philip-1, i.e. w/o Antony-(1805) went to Merlapadav managing the joint family. Because most of the menfolk used to go for work in the coffee estates and many fell prey to Malaria. Paul-1-Piad, handed over the property to Sebastian-1822 his son and with the rest went to Amembal. Since they were out of place there, they returned and lived at Mayyadi. Emmanuel-1820 lived separate with his family. Eventually George s/o Lawrence-1849 and Lawrence s/o Philip-1856 went to Cordel. After the death of John-1, his son Gabriel (1825) along with his family went to Agrar (Ponegol). His sons, Dominic (1854) and Raymond (1856) went and settled down in Chickmagalur. Their families afterwards moved to Mangalore and Bangalore. John Benjamin ---1897, s/o Raymond went to Kampala, in Uganda and rendered his service there for many years. Rosario (1880) grand son of Gabriel (1825), s/o Bonaventure (1852) went to uppinangady, and his kith and kin are there. Ignatius (1830)=Nathalia, also went to Merlapadav. Joseph Antony-1865 s/o Peter (1832)-Regina Menezes and Nathalia-1889 d/o Antony-1857, were the tenants of the Omzoor Parish, at Manarady. Finaly Stephen (1856) and the families of Philip (1828), Ignatius (1830) and Peter(1832) the sons of John-1, migrated to Fajir and lived at Mujikatta. Much of their people are still there, except some are at Koppa and Pune. John (1906) s/o Joseph Antony served in Omzoor Church for a short time and settled down at Valencia with a job at the Seminary. John-1833, s/o James-1 (1895)=Anne-1805 stayed at cana, while Michael (1826) and his brother Paul (1828) went for a time to Thevu ward, and Anna joined their sons after the demise of James-1. But after the death of Antony (1857) and Michael their families returned to Badoor. John's elder son Paschal-1863 leaving his son John-1889 at cana, went to Neermarga with his younger son Michael-1896. Some of their family people settled down at Kolkata and Bangalore. Joseph -1866. b/o Paschal after his work in the ghats settled down with his son Monthu-1902, at Padu, while his brothers: Thomas, Paul, John, Manuel -1930 (Salvadore), went to Mumbai. Much of their stock lives there. As we record this history Manvel Salvadore Evlyn Alva are the only persons left of the the fifth generation. Paul-1863 s/o Sebastian-1822 stayed at Badoor and his brother Andrew (1859) along with his sons, Joseph-1886, Thomas-1889, Xavier-1891, Joachim-1893, went to Padu ward. Later Xavier went to Naguri. 3 main factors mark the early history of our Family. Most of the young men used to go to the Ghats for work in the estates. Many succumbed to Maleria, and Cholera. The Bubonic Plague (1902) took a great toll of lives during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Vas, as Parish Priest-1899 to 1914; esp. from the stock of Philip(1784)-Mornel. For further details please refer the ancestry. The years mentioned without the brackets () are accurate, and within the () are more or less accurate.
There are 9 generations in all. Each one is specified by the number. Signs are used to simplify the chart. The Signs are: son daughter in law, followed by their children. The daughter+son in law. (Their children are not mentioned.) The * is put after the name of those who were or are single. The # is for those whose name, surname or place is unknown.
Any given sign which interlinks the similar numbers in the immediate context shows that they are members of the same family concerned. The arrow mark points out the children of the particular parents. The last 2 signs are used only where the relationships do not follow directly. We are not sure of the state of those who are not identified with any sign. Abbreviations are used for certain surnames, places and for the congregations of the Religious Sisters. They are to be sorted out from the para below. Some of the illustrious people of our family are: 1.Mr.John (1833) was awarded a diamond ring for his dedicated and hard work while constructing the First Church (1873) at Cordel. 2.Mr.Aloysius s/o Joseph of Padu was famous Assistant Commissioner of Mysore Dt. (1973-78) 3.Sr.Lydia d/o Thomas of Padu was Provincial for two terms. (1974-83). Mrs. Anna Maria d/o Michael, Neermarga received the Best Teacher Award in D.K. Dt. for the year 2002. We have 5 priests and 11 Religious Sisters among us. Please refer the ancestry for the details. Comparatively vocations for Priesthood and the Religious Life are few.
With legitimate pride in our Braggs Family, and gratitude to our ancestors, I have taken full liberty and some trouble to put on record our history and ancestry combining the tradition and the documents. By and large, our people are God fearing, hard working, peace loving and humourous. Majority belongs to the lower middle class. However some are middle class and few are poor still. Years ago they did agriculture. Recently many were employed in postal and educational departments. Nowadays they are engaged in a variety of jobs. The literacy level is average. In the practice of Religion, they are as good as others. Lately at Bytarayanapura, Bangalore 26, one family has adopted a new surname called BRAX which should not be confused with BRAGGS.
